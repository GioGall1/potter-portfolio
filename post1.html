            <div class="col">
              <p class="post-text">Hello everyone! This is Vladimir, and today I want to share with you the enchanting
                world of pottery, an art form that has captured human imagination for millennia. Every piece of pottery
                tells a story, from the careful selection of the clay to the final product emerging from the kiln.</p>
                <div class="parallax-section__post img-post__1 mb-5">
                </div>
              <h5>The Magic Begins with the Clay</h5>
              
              <p class="post-text">Every potter knows that the choice of clay is crucial. Each type of clay has its own
                characteristics and possibilities. I often use local clays because they not only provide a unique
                texture and color but also connect me to the landscape around me. The process of kneading and preparing
                the clay is meditative and sets the foundation for what's to come.</p>
                
                <div class="parallax-section__post img-post__1 mb-5">
                </div>
              <h5>Shaping Visions on the Wheel</h5>
              <p class="post-text">The potter's wheel is where the magic happens. It's a dance of hands and clay, a
                fluid motion where form and function merge. I always try to let my intuition guide me as the wheel
                spins. Each curve and contour is formed through a dialogue between the potter and the clay, a
                conversation that shapes the clay into vessels that might hold more than just physical space—they hold a
                piece of the creator’s soul.</p>
                <div class="parallax-section__post img-post__1 mb-5">
                </div>
              <h5>The Kiln’s Alchemy</h5>
              <p class="post-text">Firing is where the real transformation occurs. The kiln, with its intense heat, can
                be unpredictable. It can bring out vibrant colors and textures or it can present challenges that teach
                us resilience and adaptability. Opening the kiln after a firing is like opening a treasure chest; you
                never quite know what you'll find inside.</p>
                <div class="parallax-section__post img-post__1 mb-5">
                </div>
              <h5>Why Pottery Matters</h5>
              <p class="post-text">In our fast-paced, digital world, pottery provides a grounding connection to the
                earth and to the simplicity of the elements. It's a reminder of the beauty of creating something with
                your own hands. Each piece, with its imperfections and unique qualities, tells a story of patience,
                transformation, and the beauty of imperfection.
                <br><br>
                Thank you for joining me on this journey. Whether you are a fellow potter or someone who appreciates the
                art, I hope this post inspires you to explore the world of pottery, either by creating something
                yourself or incorporating handcrafted pieces into your life. Remember, in each piece of pottery, there’s
                a bit of the earth and a lot of heart.
