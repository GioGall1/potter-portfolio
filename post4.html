                                essential techniques, ranging from simple hand-building to more complex wheel throwing
                                and slip casting.</p>

                            <h5>Hand-Building: The Basics</h5>
                            <p class="post-text">Hand-building is one of the oldest and most accessible pottery
                                techniques. It doesn't require a pottery wheel, making it ideal for beginners.
                                <br><br>
                                <span class="fw-bold">Pinching:</span> Start with a ball of clay and use your fingers to
                                pinch and shape it into a small pot or bowl. This technique is simple and allows for a
                                lot of creativity.
                                <br><br>
                                <span class="fw-bold">Coiling:</span> Roll out long, snake-like coils of clay and layer
                                them to build up the walls of your piece. Smooth the coils together for a seamless look
                                or leave them visible for a textured effect.
                                <br><br>
                                <span class="fw-bold">Slab Building:</span> Roll out flat slabs of clay and cut them
                                into shapes, then join the shapes together to create geometric forms. This technique is
                                perfect for creating boxes, plates, and tiles.
                            </p>

                            <h5>Wheel Throwing: Mastering the Pottery Wheel</h5>
                            <p class="post-text">
                                Wheel throwing is a classic pottery technique that involves shaping clay on a spinning
                                wheel. It requires practice and precision but offers endless possibilities.
                                <br><br>
                                <span class="fw-bold">Centering:</span> The first step is to center your clay on the
                                wheel. This can be challenging, but with practice, it becomes second nature. Use both
                                hands to press and shape the clay into a symmetrical mound.
                                cleanup easier.
                                <br><br>
                                <span class="fw-bold">Opening and Pulling:</span> Once centered, use your thumbs to
                                create an opening in the clay, then pull up the walls to form a cylinder. From here, you
                                can shape the piece into a bowl, vase, or other forms.
                                regions.
                                <br><br>
                                <span class="fw-bold">Trimming:</span> After your piece has dried to a leather-hard
                                stage, trim the excess clay from the bottom to refine its shape and add a foot if
                                desired.
                            </p>
                            <div class="parallax-section__post img-post__4 mb-5">
                            </div>
                            <h5>Slip Casting: For Precision and Repetition</h5>
                            <p class="post-text">
                                Slip casting is a technique used to create precise and repeatable shapes. It's commonly
                                used for making ceramics in larger quantities.
                                <br><br>
                                <span class="fw-bold">Creating a Mold: </span> Start by making a plaster mold of the
                                shape you want to replicate. This mold will be filled with slip (liquid clay) to form
                                the piece.
                                <br><br>
                                <span class="fw-bold">Pouring the Slip:</span>Pour the slip into the mold and let it sit
                                until a thick layer forms on the inside walls. Pour out the excess slip and let the
                                remaining clay dry to a leather-hard stage.
                                <br><br>
                                <span class="fw-bold">Removing the Piece: </span> Carefully remove the leather-hard
                                piece from the mold. It can now be refined, decorated, and fired like any other pottery
                                piece.
                            </p>

                                <span class="fw-bold">Wheel Thrown and Hand-Built: </span>Start with a wheel-thrown base
                                and add hand-built elements like handles, spouts, or decorative details.
                                <br><br>
                                <span class="fw-bold">Slip Casting and Slab Building: </span> Use slip-cast components
                                as part of a larger slab-built piece, adding intricate shapes that would be difficult to
                                achieve by hand.
